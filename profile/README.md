*   🤝 **Global Vision**: We warmly welcome **developers from all over the world**! We are committed to building an **international, open, inclusive, and collaborative space**. Here, code has no borders, and creativity knows no bounds.

## 💡 Ecosystem & Inspiration

We are deeply influenced by the open-source philosophy. We pay tribute to and draw heavy inspiration from the core architecture and development patterns of:
